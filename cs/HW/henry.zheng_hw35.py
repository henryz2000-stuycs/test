Mechanism for Madlibification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. create the lists of nouns/adjectives/verbs that are going to be used in the text
   and assign a variable to each of these lists (NOUN,ADJ,etc...)

2. Write a helper function that selects/returns a random element in the list.
   This helper function will take in the list of nouns or adjs as parameter, generates a random index in the range of len(list),
   and then returns the corresponding element in the list.
   
3. copy&paste the rest of the text that is given, assign a variable to each section of them.
   (sec1,sec2,sec3,etc...)

4. Write a function that takes in the sections of the text in order and adds the selected nouns/adjs in between them, and generates/returns a complete body text.
