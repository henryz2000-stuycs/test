HW01 -- Onward! To the land of CS
2016-02-04

My CS journey thus far has not been a very eventful one.
The only major point in this journey would be IntroCS1.
Here, I learned all that I know so far about CS.
It has been somewhat of a bumpy road, with lots of twists and turns.
However, that is how you learn.
I've enjoyed learning how to think differently in CS, such as in prefix notation for scheme.
I've also enjoyed learning a visual language (ie. netlogo).
The most enjoyable part of IntroCS1 was learning together, with partners, as I feel that they can assist you a lot throughout your journey in CS.
Another time of partner work was the final project, which was also fun due to your unlimited (although somewhat limited due to your knowledge of netlogo) choices of projects.
